Add all the html files in the main directory so they can easily reference each other and then add all specific stylesheets or images to folders named after your page.
The misc folder contains common elements used by all pages. We could add a universal stylesheet to this folder referenced by all pages so that the settings page can 
modify this single sheet and it will affect all pages.
